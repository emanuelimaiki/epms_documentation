# Authentication

## Overview

This document details the implementation of an authentication and authorization system using Node.js, Express, Mongoose, JWT, and additional features like email and OTP verification. It covers user registration, email verification, role-based access control, and password reset functionalities.

## System Setup

### Dependencies

To set up the project, you need the following dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install express mongoose jsonwebtoken bcryptjs nodemailer dotenv
```

### Configuration

Ensure your environment variables are set in a `.env` file for:

- MongoDB connection (`MONGO_URI`)
- JWT secret key (`JWT_SECRET`)
- Email transport configuration (`EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASS`, `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_SECURE`)

## Features

### User Registration

Users can register with a username, email, and password. Upon registration, a verification email and SMS are sent.

```javascript
// POST /api/auth/register
{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
```

### Email Verification

An email with a verification link is sent to the user's email upon registration. Clicking the link verifies their email.

### Phone Verification

An SMS with a verification code is sent to the user's phone upon registration. The user must enter this code to verify their phone number.

### User Login

Users can log in using their email and password. Upon successful login, a JWT token is provided for accessing protected routes.

```javascript
// POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
```

### Role-Based Access Control

Different routes can be accessed based on the user's role, defined during the registration or set by an admin.

### Password Reset

Users can reset their password by requesting a password reset link or an OTP. Both methods verify the user's identity before allowing a password change.

```javascript
// POST /api/auth/request-password-reset-email
{ "email": "john@example.com" }

// POST /api/auth/reset-password-with-token
{
  "token": "generated-reset-token",
  "newPassword": "newSecurePassword123"
}
```

## Security Considerations

- Store sensitive information such as passwords and tokens securely using hashing and environment variables.
- Ensure all data transmitted over the network is secured using HTTPS.
- Use rate limiting and monitoring to prevent abuse and detect anomalies in real-time.

## Conclusion

This system provides robust security for user authentication and authorization, leveraging modern technologies and best practices for web security. Ensure thorough testing and updates to maintain security standards.
