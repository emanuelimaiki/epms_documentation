# Geting Started

## Description

This document serves as the comprehensive guide for the Evoton Property Management System (EPMS), which is designed to manage properties efficiently through tools provided for landlords, tenants, and property managers. EPMS is integrated within the broader Evoton suite of applications, ensuring seamless interaction and a consistent user experience across platforms.

## System Architecture

- **Backend**: Utilizes Node.js with Express for robust API services.
- **Frontend**: Employs React for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **Database**: MongoDB, selected for its scalability, flexibility, and speed.
- **Authentication**: Auth0, implemented for secure and flexible cross-platform authentication.

## Database Configuration: MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database renowned for its high performance, high availability, and ease of scalability. It is ideal for EPMS due to the following advantages:

- **Schema-less Nature**: MongoDB's flexibility allows it to store different types of data without predefined schema constraints, which is perfect for the diverse data involved in property management.
- **Scalability**: MongoDB scales horizontally with ease, facilitating growth as EPMS expands in terms of properties and users.
- **Performance**: Offers fast data access with efficient indexing that supports rapid queries on any attribute.
- **Flexibility**: Data is stored in JSON-like documents, which simplifies the integration of data from various sources.

## Authentication: Auth0

Auth0 is used to manage authentication and authorization across all Evoton systems, providing:

- **Unified User Experience**: Simplifies user interaction across all platforms within the Evoton ecosystem by maintaining a single identity.
- **Security Features**: Includes robust options like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), encryption, and regular security audits.
- **Flexibility**: Supports a wide range of identity protocols such as OAuth, OpenID Connect, and SAML.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling millions of users without a decline in performance.

## Implementation Details

### MongoDB Integration

- **Connection Setup**: Details the process for connecting the EPMS to MongoDB, including configuration of environment settings and security measures.
- **Model Definitions**: Describes the data models for properties, leases, and user accounts, including the schema definitions and relationships between models.

### Auth0 Setup

- **Configuration**: Outlines the steps to integrate Auth0 with EPMS, including the setup of APIs in Auth0, definition of permissions, and integration with both backend and frontend components.
- **Roles and Permissions**: Explains the management of roles in Auth0 and how permissions are assigned to ensure proper access control within EPMS.

## Security Considerations

Discusses additional security measures, including:

- **Data Encryption**: Both at rest and in transit, sensitive data is encrypted to protect against unauthorized access.
- **Regular Audits**: Scheduled security audits ensure that EPMS remains secure against emerging threats.
- **Compliance**: Ensures that all operations comply with relevant data protection regulations.

## Future Enhancements

Provides a vision for future enhancements, potentially including:

- **IoT Integrations**: For advanced property management capabilities.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Tools to monitor and analyze property performance.
- **Enhanced Portals**: Improved tenant and landlord portals offering extensive self-service options.

## Conclusion

This documentation summarizes the purpose, structure, and strategic benefits of the EPMS, highlighting its alignment with the goals of efficiency, security, and user satisfaction.
